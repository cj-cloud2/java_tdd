## **Assignment 1: Basic Loan Application Intake**

### **1) Complete Assignment Description**

**Service goal:**
Accept and validate raw loan applications.

**Test Cases:**

1. Validate application with all required fields present.
2. Reject application missing mandatory field(s).
3. Ensure newly accepted applications are persisted (mock repository).

**Service class after this step:**
Handles intake and simple validation, persists loan applications.

## **2️⃣ loan_service/repository.py**

```python

# Assignment 1 — New Code
# ========================


from .models import LoanApplication

        # This is an abstract method that raises an error if not overridden in a subclass

        # Check if the provided application is valid using internal validation

## **5️⃣ Optional: main.py**

    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize an internal list to store loan applications


    def save(self, application: LoanApplication):
        # Append the loan application to internal storage
        # Print confirmation that the application has been saved


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create in-memory repository instance
    # Initialize LoanProcessingService with repository
    # Create a sample loan application
    # Submit the application to the service
    # Print whether the application was accepted
